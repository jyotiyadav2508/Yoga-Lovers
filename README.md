## Testing 
I tested the following:
- all the pages of the website on different browsers: Chrome, Edge, Safari.
- When a nav element is clicked, it provides the navigation link to the respective page. 
- the responsiveness of the website on different screen sizes (Mobile S-320px, Mobile M-375px, Mobile L-425px, Tablet-768px, Laptop-1024px) using Devtools sevice toolbar. The different CSS propoerties for font, color, background-color, links, submit button work as expected.
- animation of the hero-image text moves within the defined area.
- when social link in the footer is clicked, it directs to the respective social media page.


## Bugs

## Fixed bugs

- on different pages of the website, header background color was not visible on smaller devices.
  - to solve this bug, I used flex-direction:column instead of display:inline
  ![flex-direction]((https://github.com/jyotiyadav2508/Yoga-Lovers/blob/main/screenshots/flex.png))
  - additionally, for code optimization, I removed repeated use of background color property from each media query. 

- Submission on contact page submits the information without validating the required entries.
  - to solve this bug, I removed the anchor tag as a descendent of the button and added the link in the form tag.
